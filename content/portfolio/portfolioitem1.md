Ronan and the lost Ruby is a 3d/2.5d game made with the godot engine. The protagonist is Ronan, who wakes up to discover his ruby has been stolen. He sees an open portal in his bedroom, so he ventures into it. He discovers a weird world full of chickens which seems to be ruled by Count Hahn and where you can only walk forwards. When he finds another portal, he can finally move on the z-axis. I'm not very good at telling a story. Will he be able to find back his ruby, defeat Count Hahn, and find his way back home?
