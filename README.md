# Jasperro's website

This is my personal website made with eleventy. I used tailwindcss for the styling, with a custom gulp configuration for that. 

```
yarn install
````

__Commands__

* Run `yarn start` for a development server and live reloading
* Run `yarn run build` to generate a production build

## Credits

Thanks to Max BÃ¶ck for his amazing eleventy site base template eleventastic, which offered a great base which this site could build on.
