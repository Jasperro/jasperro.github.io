# Jasperro's website

This is my personal website made with eleventy and tailwind. The icon generation and development server are handled by gulp and the css generation by postcss.

**Installation**

```
npx pnpm add -g pnpm
pnpm install
```

**Commands**

-   Run `pnpm start` for a development server and live reloading
-   Run `pnpm run build` to generate a production build

## Credits

Thanks to Max BÃ¶ck for his amazing eleventy site template eleventastic, which the svg sprite code and netlify config was based on.
